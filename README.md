## Introduction

* Prolog Interpretor wriiten in ocaml. Most General Unifier and pattern matching algorithms have been used to implement prolog interpreter .
* plgparser.ml file is the main file where bactracking and unification has been coded to implement basic prolog inference engine.

## Usage
Usage :-  ./parser "prolog file name"

##Compiling
- ocaml needs to be installed in the system with ocamyacc, ocamllex, ocamlc in the environment path variable. 
- Just make to build the project again. The code files are self explanatory about what function they are performing.

Some sample prolog files have been added for quick check.
