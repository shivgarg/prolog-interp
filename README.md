prolog-interp
=============

- Prolog Interpretor wriiten in ocaml. General Unifiers used to infer prolog relations. Many fetaures of prolog included, use it, add missing features and extend it.
-plgparser.ml file is the main file where bactracking and unification has been coded to implement basic prolog inference engine.
### Usgae
Usage :-  ./parser <prolog file name>

###Compiling
- ocaml needs to be installed in the system with ocamyacc, ocamllex, ocamlc in the environment path variable. 
- Just make to build the project again. The code files are self explanatory about what function they are performing.

Some sample prolog files have been added for quick check.
